Set of scripts and files to make steam running as separate user
without root-access at any moment.

I've done manually steam.deb unpacking and install all required library
(see steam_demand and steam_libs).

steam_offline run same steam without internet access. It heavily relies on
'offlined' snapshot on ~steam folder (I do it with btrfs, not included)

Use at your own risk. Please note, that pulseaudio and xhost settings poses
significant security risks.
